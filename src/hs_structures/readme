HS Structures: turrets, tripwires, and more.

== Overview ==
This module adds support for building strategic structures. The mechanics 
are a bit similar to that of fields; players purchase an item that allows 
them to create structures, then they go to the build location and start 
building. After they haven't moved for a specified amount of time, the 
structure (usually a fake player) appears.
